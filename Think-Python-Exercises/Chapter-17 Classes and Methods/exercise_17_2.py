"""
This exercise is a cautionary tale about one of the most common, and difficult to find,
errors in Python. Write a definition for a class named Kangaroo with the following
methods:

1. An __init__ method that initializes an attribute named pouch_contents to an
empty list.

2. A method named put_in_pouch that takes an object of any type and adds it to
pouch_contents .

3. A __str__ method that returns a string representation of the Kangaroo object
and the contents of the pouch.


Test your code by creating two Kangaroo objects, assigning them to variables named
kanga and roo , and then adding roo to the contents of kanga â€™s pouch.
